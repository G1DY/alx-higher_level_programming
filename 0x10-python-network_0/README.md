<center> <h1>Python - Network #0</h1> </center>
This Project entails understanding TCP/IP transport and internet protocols. We used ```curl``` as the preferred to tool to transfer data to and from a server. I learned about URL's , HTTPS, Domain & Sub-Domain names and how they work. I also digged deeper on HTTPS methods(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, TRACE, OPTIONS), how to write the requests and response syntax.I wrote ```Bash``` scripts to send various types of HTTP requests. Task 6 was an algorithmn challenge to find a peak in a list of unsorted integers at its lowest complexity
