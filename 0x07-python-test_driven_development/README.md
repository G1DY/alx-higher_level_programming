#### Tasks
> 0. Integers addition

>> Write a function that adds 2 integers; a and b must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message a must be an integer or b must be an integer

> 1. Divide a matrix

>> Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix; matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
Each row of the matrix must be of the same size, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message Each row of the matrix must have the same size
div must be a number (integer or float), otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message div must be a number
div can’t be equal to 0, otherwise raise a ZeroDivisionError exception with the message division by zero

> 2. Say my name

>> Write a function that prints My name is <first name> <last name>; first_name and last_name must be strings otherwise, raise a TypeError exception with the message first_name must be a string or last_name must be a string

> 3. Print square

>> Write a function that prints a square with the character #; size is the size length of the square
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
if size is a float and is less than 0, raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer

> 4. Text indentation

>> Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and ; text must be a string, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message text must be a string

> 5. Max integer - Unittest

>> Since the beginning you have been creating “Interactive tests”. For this exercise, you will add Unittests.
